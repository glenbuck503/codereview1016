    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <p>I was bon in Portland,OR on March 28th, 1985. I have worked in the Tax Professional Industry and Service Industrty for the last ten years. I recently was introduced to coding back in 2017 by a few freinds and ever since, I have always been intrigued and interested in the field. I tend to have a goofy and outgoing personailty but when it comes to working and or learning something new, I am <strong>100</strong> percent serious. I am hoping to gain as much as I can during the next 6 months and hope I can apply it in the field.</p>

      <p class="learntext">There are a lot of things I am hoping to accomplish during my time here in the Epicodus program. For starters, <span class="best"> I</span> hope to gain the basic understandings and fundementals of programming. I know that I <span class="best"> will</span> run into roadblocks and walls from time to time, probably more often than not.There most certainly will <span class="best"> always</span> be struggles. But with this program, I will learn to <span class="best"> do</span> things I could never imagine possible. With time, I know that <span class="best">my</span> knowledge and understanding of the things we learn here will be <span class="best">best</span> for my futre. </p>
