    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <p>I was bon in Portland,OR on March 28th, 1985. I have worked in the Tax Professional Industry and Service Industrty for the last ten years. I recently was introduced to coding back in 2017 by a few freinds and ever since, I have always been intrigued and interested in the field. I am hoping to gain as much as I can during the next 6 months and hope I can apply it in the field.</p>
